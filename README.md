The Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset is a collection of information
that helps understand what customers like and how they buy things. It has details like who the customers 
are (demographics), what they have bought before, the kinds of products they prefer, and whether they shop online or in stores. 
This information is really useful for companies because it helps them create better strategies to meet what customers want, 
make their shopping experience better, and increase sales and customer loyalty.
